# Alien Invasion
A simple game based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders.

## General info

The player starts out with three lives represented as ships.  You must move the ship using the left and right-arrow keys on your keyboard.  Also, tap the spacebar to shoot bullets at the aliens moving across the screen.  If any remaining aliens reach the bottom of the screen, or hit the ship, then the player loses one ship.  If you lose all three ships, then the game is over.
